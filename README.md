# hello-world
my first repository
this is my commit.  MY first commit.  I'm learning.  I've learned to make a meaninigless commit in github and make a branch off the master.   Lets all pray I advance a bit further than just this in my self taught coding escapades.  seriously though pray for me.  I would like to miraculously learn how to code (not without effort, learning, and coding of course...got to put in the work...) but I feel a major miracle will need to occur for me to get as far as I'd like.
